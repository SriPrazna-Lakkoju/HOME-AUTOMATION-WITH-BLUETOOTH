DESCRIPTION:
Home Automation with Bluetooth lets you control home devices (like lights, fans, etc.) using your smartphone through Bluetooth.
You don’t need to touch switches — just tap buttons on your phone!

HOW DOES IT WORK?
You press a button in a mobile app (like Bluetooth Terminal or a custom app).

The command is sent over Bluetooth to an Arduino (or any microcontroller).

The Arduino receives the command and turns ON or OFF the connected devices (like a light or fan).
